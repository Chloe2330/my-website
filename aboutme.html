        Hello, my name is Chloe Lin and I'm a rising senior at Mission San Jose High School. I was born in Akron, Ohio and grew up in the Bay Area. I am planning to major in computer science and philosophy, with a focus on tech ethics, algorithimic transparency, and cybersecurity. I have a lot of experience working with younger children through sports and tutoring, so I also plan to step into an educational role in the future.<br> <br>
